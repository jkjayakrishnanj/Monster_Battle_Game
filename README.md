# Monster_Battle_Game
This project implements a turn-based strategy game where monsters compete against each other in battle. The objective is to defeat opposing monsters through tactical selection of actions. The game includes a basic type system for monsters and their actions, status effects, and mechanics for boosting or weakening monster stats. Monsters and their actions are not hardcodedâ€”they are loaded dynamically from an external input file, allowing for flexible and complex interactions.
