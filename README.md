# Monster_Battle_Game
This project is a fully-featured, terminal-based, turn-based monster battle simulator. Monsters with elemental types and custom actions face off in strategic battles with stat manipulation, damage calculation, and status effects. The game loads configuration from a custom-designed DSL parsed by a lexer and parser built from scratch.
